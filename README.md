# hello-world
There was a time when I could only tell you about my past and where I have been.  Here lately its been all about my future and where I am going.  I start The Iron Yard this fall to begin my journey into Front End Engineering.  I have always dabbled in websites and creating pages for family and friends, but never considered it as a career.  Well the opportunity came up and I am going to take the bull by the horns and run with it.  Quiting everything I have ever known and basically reprogramming my brain to learn something new.  Exciting times await and looking for the great opportunities and experiences that await me in my new adventure.
